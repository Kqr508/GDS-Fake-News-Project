How to Run Simple_Regression?
Task 1:
1:
   - You need to use the cleaned dataset from Part 1.
   - Make sure the data file is named "cleaned_dataset_FULL.csv"
   - (or change the line in the notebook to:
   -  DATA_FILE = "cleaned_dataset_FULL.csv").

2: YOU DO NOT need to run the This part of notebook that generates the vocabulary. 
  - The titel of this part caled:
  - "Hvorfor har vi køret det? fordi vi kunne ikke tæller op de orderne. Dvs at rækkerne var strang og vi kunne ikke kunveret den till 
    metrix."
 
 -(Why haven't I removed it? Because it's proof of where the "vocabulary_10000.csv" file came from.)


3: 
  - You need to have the "vocabulary_10000.csv" file.
  - It’s available in the Simple_Regr folder on GitHub, inside a ZIP file.

Task 2:
    - You need to have completed Part 1 and have the file "cleaned_dataset_FULL.csv".
    - If you run all the cells in this part, it should work just fine.

Task 3:
    - You need to load "cleaned_bbc_articles_FULL.csv".
    - This file is also in the Simple_Regr folder on GitHub, inside a ZIP file.
