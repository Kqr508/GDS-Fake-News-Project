## To the Examiner
Below is a list of folders where you can find the code for the different tasks throughout the project.
Within the respective folder, it will be noted what the requirements are to run the programs and how they should be executed to reproduce our results.
As we produced some large files during the project that could not be uploaded to GitHub and thus are not included in the repository, it is strongly recommended to run the programs in chronological order according to their appearance in the task descriptions or in the order they appear below:

**Part 1**
1) [``Cleaning Program``](https://github.com/Kqr508/GDS-Fake-News-Project/tree/main/Cleaning%20Program) folder contains the solution for *Task 1* and *Task 2*.
2) [``Data exploration``](https://github.com/Kqr508/GDS-Fake-News-Project/tree/main/Data%20exploration) folder contains the solution for *Task 3*.
3) [``Splitting Program``](https://github.com/Kqr508/GDS-Fake-News-Project/tree/main/Splitting%20Program) folder contains the solution for *Task 4* and *Part 2, Task 0*.

**Part 2**
1) [``Simple_Regr``](https://github.com/Kqr508/GDS-Fake-News-Project/tree/main/Simple_Regr) folder contains the solution for *Task 1, Task 2* and *Task 3*.

**Part 3**
1) [``Advanced Model``](https://github.com/Kqr508/GDS-Fake-News-Project/tree/main/Advanced%20Model) folder contains the solution for *Part 3* and *Part 2, Task 1*. ⁕

**Part 4**
1) [``Evaluation``](https://github.com/Kqr508/GDS-Fake-News-Project/tree/main/Evaluation) folder contains the solution for *Part 4*.

⁕ This is because *Part 2* was only completed long after *Part 3* and *Part 4*.
